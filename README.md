# House_Price_Prediction
A Gradient Boosting model predicting house prices using engineered features from property data, optimized through preprocessing and cross-validation.

A machine learning model was developed to predict house prices using the Kaggle dataset "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." The task focused on estimating the property sale price based on various physical and categorical features of residential homes.

Key components of the workflow included:
- Data Preprocessing: Missing values were handled, irrelevant or sparse features removed, and categorical variables encoded.
- Feature Engineering: Additional features such as TotalSF, TotalBath, and HouseAge were derived to enhance model performance.
- Model Selection: A Gradient Boosting Regressor was employed due to its effectiveness in regression tasks with structured tabular data.
- Model Validation: Cross-validation and visualization techniques were used to assess performance.
